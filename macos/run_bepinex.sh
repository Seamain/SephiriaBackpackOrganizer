# Based on the stock run_bepinex.sh shipped with BepInEx (LGPL-2.1),
# with two macOS-specific changes; both are marked with comments below:
#   1. re-exec through `arch -x86_64` on Apple Silicon (BepInEx's bundled
#      MonoMod only emits x86/x64 detours, so Harmony patches need Rosetta)
#   2. stash/restore DYLD_* around the helper commands this script runs
#      (needed when SIP is disabled and Steam injects its overlay)
#
# BepInEx start script
#
# Run the script to start the game with BepInEx enabled
#
# There are two ways to use this script
#
# 1. Via CLI: Run ./run_bepinex.sh <path to game> [doorstop arguments] [game arguments]
# 2. Via config: edit the options below and run ./run.sh without any arguments

# LINUX: name of Unity executable
# MACOS: name of the .app directory
executable_name="Sephiria.app"

# All of the below can be overriden with command line args

# General Config Options

# Enable Doorstop?
# 0 is false, 1 is true
enabled="1"

# Path to the assembly to load and execute
# NOTE: The entrypoint must be of format `static void Doorstop.Entrypoint.Start()`
target_assembly="BepInEx/core/BepInEx.Unity.Mono.Preloader.dll"

# Overrides the default boot.config file path
boot_config_override=

# If enabled, DOORSTOP_DISABLE env var value is ignored
# USE THIS ONLY WHEN ASKED TO OR YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS
ignore_disable_switch="0"

# Mono Options

# Overrides default Mono DLL search path
# Sometimes it is needed to instruct Mono to seek its assemblies from a different path
# (e.g. mscorlib is stripped in original game)
# This option causes Mono to seek mscorlib and core libraries from a different folder before Managed
# Original Managed folder is added as a secondary folder in the search path
# To specify multiple paths, separate them with colons (:)
dll_search_path_override="BepInEx/core"

# If 1, Mono debugger server will be enabled
debug_enable="0"

# When debug_enabled is 1, specifies the address to use for the debugger server
debug_address="127.0.0.1:10000"

# If 1 and debug_enabled is 1, Mono debugger server will suspend the game execution until a debugger is attached
debug_suspend="0"

# CoreCLR options (IL2CPP)

# Path to coreclr shared library WITHOUT THE EXTENSION that contains the CoreCLR runtime
coreclr_path=""

# Path to the directory containing the managed core libraries for CoreCLR (mscorlib, System, etc.)
corlib_dir=""

# BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE: take DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES out of the environment.
#
# When the game is started through Steam's launch options, Steam has already
# put its overlay (gameoverlayrenderer.dylib) in DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES. That
# dylib ships x86_64 + arm64 but no arm64e slice. On a machine with SIP
# disabled dyld stops ignoring DYLD_* for Apple's own arm64e binaries, so
# every helper this script forks -- uname, sysctl, arch, defaults, file --
# aborts with "missing compatible architecture ... need 'arm64e'" before it
# can print a thing. Stash the values here and put them back just before the
# game is exec'd, which is the only process that should actually get them.
# The guard matters: this script re-executes itself through `arch` below, so
# without it the second pass would overwrite the stash with the empty value
# the first pass just installed, and Steam's overlay would be lost.
