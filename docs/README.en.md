A BepInEx plugin for *Sephiria* (Steam AppID 2436940). Press **F8** to auto-arrange your inventory so all the synergy mechanics trigger at once: tablet coverage, charm position conditions, planet clusters, harmony crystals, dedication badges, the Kelsardanni Key cycle rows, compass original-target binding, white-paper combo filling and the glowing hourglass.

- Version: v2.5.4
- Fixed abnormally low sorting priority for weapon-exclusive / special-attack related artifacts
- **Due to the author's academic commitments, development is paused for now. Pull requests are still very welcome and will be merged from time to time.**
- Added macOS support
- Added custom artifact binding: hold Ctrl and middle-click an artifact to give it a binding (artifacts you manually placed next to the bound position will not be changed by auto-sort)
- White paper, hourglass and Ray's Star Fragment now bind automatically when you manually place the artifact you want boosted in the matching position
- Kriton's Seal priority raised to P2 (gold tier)
- Runtime: BepInEx 6 (Unity Mono) / Unity 6000.3.21f1 / Mirror multiplayer
- Platforms: Windows / macOS
- Works for solo, host and multiplayer clients

Press **F8** to arrange your bag: before on the left, after on the right (install instructions below).

## Features

- **One-key arrangement**: press F8 to re-arrange the bag; a "done" toast appears when finished
- **Manual priority (rewritten)**: middle-click an artifact to cycle P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → cleared (back to default), independently per artifact, with a small transparent marker at the lower-left of its icon. The manual priority directly overrides the default sorting priority and reuses the normal priority logic
- **Background search + frame-sliced apply**: host and clients search in the background, then apply swaps/rotations in validated per-frame batches with safe rollback
- **Fully offline scoring model**: simulates the game's real bonus formulas on a copy of your bag — any layout gets a score, and the search optimizes that score
- **Multi-round simulated annealing**: 4 independent search rounds (different random seeds) per press, taking the global best; a full 34-slot bag takes about 200–300 ms
- **Smart initial layout**: tablets → restricted charms → cyclic/fixed-row charms → planet module → harmony crystals → dedication badge → hourglass → planet clustering → compass original-target binding → white-paper combo filling → remaining charms → burdens into the worst cells
- **Supported mechanics** (all mirror the game's real formulas):
  - Tablet effect grids (+level / ×multiplier / disable / ignore-criteria cells) with rotation
  - Charm position conditions (top / bottom / sides / inside / outlined / both sides empty / both sides charm / all neighbors full / near a magic book)
  - Ignore-criteria cells first (Ice Lock style)
  - Planet telescope clusters (8 surrounding cells; excludable items such as Galaxy Sheet Music)
  - Harmony crystal: damage scales with the level-sum of the 8 surrounding cells
  - Dedication badge: strengthens all companion items on the same row
  - **Kelsardanni Key**: counts the existing STURDY / EMBER / GLACIER / MAGITECH synergies and picks the most numerous one; rows 1/2/3/4 map to the four types and repeat every 4 rows, so STURDY picks the best cell among rows 1/5/9
  - **Compass original-target binding**: a compass that already points at a damage item before sorting keeps following the same item instance and stays right below it; stacked compasses move as one vertical chain; only unpaired compasses auto-seek a target
  - **Golden-needle target gets maxed first**: the artifact locked by the north-pointing golden needle is forced to top priority and receives levels first, regardless of rarity
  - **White-paper combo filling**: counts each combo's current count vs. its max tier, prefers the largest combo that is not full yet, and places the white paper between two items of that combo — e.g. auto-fills STURDY 9/10 → 10/10
  - **Glowing hourglass: automatically placed left of the magic book with the longest cooldown** (the magic book on its right gains +30/60/100% cooldown recovery)
  - **Multipurpose Belt support**: when the belt is active, its effect stacks once per artifact in the top row — the sorter packs as many artifacts as possible into the top row
  - **Low-level-value charms**: Shadow Eye and Lizard Plate Armor gain almost nothing from levels — their level score is discounted so they only need to stay active (level ≥ 0) without chasing high levels; the Fault Detection Probe is simply demoted to normal priority (level 4)
  - **Minimum-level targets**: Galaxy Sheet Music is forced to top priority and guaranteed to reach effective level 2
  - Negative items like Mind Burden are forced into the worst (negative-level) cells
  - Mystic ×2 cells (unlocked at 2 / 5 mystic items)
  - Configurable fixed-row items
  - Weapon-related charms (activated only when the current weapon type matches)
  - Enchant levels and a priority system (Legend/Bond > Rare > Advanced > Common)
- **Multiplayer client support**: without server authority, the plugin computes the optimal layout locally, then applies it through the game's own network ops (Swap / DoClickAction) step by step — never clears the bag
- **Safety**: waits 3 s for the bag to initialize after entering a session, verifies a snapshot before sorting, applies the result once and never retries, to avoid item loss

## Installation

### Option 1: Full package (recommended, easiest)

1. Open **Releases** (top right of this page) and download the latest full package (file name like `SephiriaBackpackOrganizer-v2.5.4.zip`)
2. Unzip it — you will get a `BepInEx` folder, `winhttp.dll` and other files
3. Copy everything into your game folder: in Steam, right-click *Sephiria* → Manage → Browse local files, and paste over it
4. Launch the game from Steam, then press **F8** in-game to sort your bag

> The full package already bundles the BepInEx 6 framework and the plugin itself — nothing else to install; re-installing is safe, just overwrite.

### Option 2: macOS

The full package above is for Windows. For the native macOS build, see
[macos/README.en.md](../macos/README.en.md):

```sh
cd macos && ./install.sh
```

The script downloads that same full package, builds the loader macOS needs, and installs it.
Note that on macOS the hotkey is **fn + F8** (plain F8 is a system media key) — the document explains why.

### Uninstall

Delete `游戏目录/BepInEx/plugins/SephiriaBackpackOrganizer.dll`; to remove the framework completely as well, also delete the whole `BepInEx` folder plus `winhttp.dll` and `doorstop_config.ini` (only if you have not installed other BepInEx plugins).

## Usage

- Press **F8** in game to sort your bag; a "done" toast appears when finished
- Middle-click an artifact in the bag to set manual priority: 1 click = P1, 2 = P2, 3 = P3, 4 = P4, one more click clears it; each artifact cycles independently
- All settings live in `游戏目录/BepInEx/config/com.sephiria.backpack-organizer.cfg` — restart the game after editing

| Synergy | CompassBonus | 12000 | Reward for a compass keeping its original target (unpaired ones auto-pair); 0 does not disable original-target binding |
| Synergy | BeltItems | Multipurpose Belt | Belt-style charm keys; when active, the sorter packs the top row with artifacts |
| Synergy | BeltRowBonus | 2500 | Bonus per artifact in the top row while a belt is active |
| Burden | NegativeCellPenalty | 20000 | Penalty when a burden is not on a negative cell |

## How it works (short)

1. **Recognize**: classify bag items (tablets / charms / burdens / misc) and identify each mechanic's items (by type or a configured key)
2. **Score**: simulate all the game's bonus formulas offline and score any layout (level × priority weight, enabled/disabled, planet clusters, harmony crystals, dedication badges, Kelsardanni Key cycle rows, compass original-target binding, white-paper combos, hourglass–magic book, burden penalty, fixed-row constraints, …)
3. **Search**: smart initial layout + multi-start multi-round simulated annealing (directed moves + random exploration), take the global best layout
4. **Apply**: host writes the whole layout back at once; multiplayer clients translate it into swap/rotate sequences executed step by step
